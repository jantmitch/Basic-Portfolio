        <p>My name is Anthony Mitchell. If you can't tell from the picture, I really enjoy golf. I've been playing the sport since the age of 13. Before I got into this program I was a greenskeeper at East Lake Golf Club. The most notable thing I did while working at ELGC, was working the final tournament of the PGA Tour, The Tour Championship.</p>
        
        <br> 
    
        <p>I decided to enroll in this program to further my knowledge in web development. I am excited to take the knowledge learned in this program to find a new career in the industry. There are a ton of people in my corner pushing me to succeed. </p>
